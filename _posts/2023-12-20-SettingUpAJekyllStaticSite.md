title: Setting up a Jekyll static site, hosted on GitHub
---

Originally I wrote a custom PHP application with a MySQL DB and fronted with jquery and styled with bootstrap CSS. This was a fun and interesting project however PHP versions changed, database versions changed, and the libraries for the front end changed so it needed more attention than I have had time to devote towards it. Instead I have come across this Chirpy theme on Jekyll that looks great and requires minimal updates.

This is an initial sample post to get me started.
